## Mario Kart Channel Comment Extender

Extends the Mario Kart Channel keyboard and comment to be able to have 31 characters (even though there's 32 key spaces, the last one does not work - if enabled, breaks the text). The text can be way longer if RAM edited. I cannot find how to extend the keyboard or the key space writing limit even more. Can be used for pictures or just for fun
