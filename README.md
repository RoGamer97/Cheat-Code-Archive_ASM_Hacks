## About

Welcome to my collection of cheat codes (ASM hacks) for various games across multiple platforms. Here, you'll find many crazy, fun, cool, and useful codes to experiment with.

### Organization

Folders are organized by platform. Inside each platform folder, you'll find:

- **Game name folder**: Labeled with the **version** first, followed by either the **Game ID**, **Title ID**, or **Build ID**. The **Build ID** is based on the version of the game if different versions have no different **Title ID**.
- All the codes for that game inside the corresponding game name folder.

Some related codes are grouped together in single files. If a file name includes ```... Codes (X Codes)```, it contains multiple related codes (where X is the number of codes in that file). Be sure to review the file carefully when searching for a specific code.

## Details

While I aim to share as many codes as possible, some must remain private and cannot be shared to avoid problems online.

Please enjoy these codes as much as I enjoyed making them!
