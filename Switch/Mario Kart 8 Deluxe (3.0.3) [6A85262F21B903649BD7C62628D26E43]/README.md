## About the Christmas Pack and Code Releases

The Christmas Release RAR includes a collection of fun and useful IPS patches and cheat codes that I shared during Christmas 2023. You might find some new codes and patches in the GitHub folders that aren’t included in the RAR, but everything in the RAR is also available in the folders.

To avoid issues with online play, time trials, and potential bans, many of the codes I created can’t be shared here. I’ve made the most codes for Deluxe, but most of them offer unfair advantages or change the gameplay too much. For now, I’ll be putting Deluxe content on hold, but I may post some codes that won’t affect time trials or online play occasionally.

Thanks for understanding!
