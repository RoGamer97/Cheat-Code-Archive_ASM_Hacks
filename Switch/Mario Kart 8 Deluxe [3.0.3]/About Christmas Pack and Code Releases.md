## About Christmas Pack and Code Releases

The Christmas Release RAR includes a compilation of many fun and useful IPS patches and codes that I released in 2023's Christmas. 
You may see new codes and patches that are not included in the RAR included in the GitHub folders but you'll see all content included in the RAR in the folders too.

To avoid abuse of codes online and bans, there are haundred of codes I made that cannot be included here, in fact, I think out of all games in this archive, the most amount of codes I made were for Deluxe
but almost all of them can cause issues online, perhaps some codes that don't do much online can be added (for example, codes that may change how objects behave but doesn't give any advantage or
changes that can be seen by others. I'll think with time...

Please understand. Thank you!
