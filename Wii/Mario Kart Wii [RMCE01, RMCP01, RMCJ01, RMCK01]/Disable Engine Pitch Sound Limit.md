## Disable Engine Pitch Sound Limit

This code removes the vehicle's engine pitch limit, if driving at max speed normally, no difference can be heard, but if using speed hacks, the pitch different is noticeable and the fastest you are, the highest the pitch is. This code will make the vehicle sound exactly the same when you use speed hacks in MKDS.
