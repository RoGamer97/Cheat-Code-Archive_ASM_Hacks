## Remove Invincibility Period After Hitting Cars/Trucks in Moonview Highway

This code removes the invincibility period that the player has against the cars and trucks in Moonview Highway if getting hit by them. This only happens in the Moonview Highway slot and code can be written to only affect specific custom track slots. The timer can be configured by modifying the compare next to the address of my code.
