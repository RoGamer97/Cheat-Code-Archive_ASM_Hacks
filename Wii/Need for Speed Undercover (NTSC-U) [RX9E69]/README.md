## About the Code Pack RAR

The code pack RAR contains all the codes I've created, along with a few codes made by others. Codes I DID NOT MAKE are included in the RAR but are not part of the GitHub "Codes" folder. Other than that, the content is the same.

The RAR file also includes important information on the code file line limit, how to work around it, and how to change specific code button activators.

Here's a video of the code pack (Slighty outdated compared): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckDkR3GIqsw
