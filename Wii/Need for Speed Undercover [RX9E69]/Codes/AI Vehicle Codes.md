<details>
<summary>Every AI Vehicle is Player Cop 911 GT2</summary>

AIs (racers, perps etc, except cops) will drive Cop 911 GT2 (the one the player uses in Multiplayer Cops & Robbers). You can customize it to any vehicle by changing the vehicle hash ("C3D26AD2") to another's vehicle hash.
To get a hash, use NFS Hasher v2.0 by nfsu360 and input the vehicle string name and copy the value from "VLT Memory" to the code. Unfortunately, you cannot change it to an AI vehicle

<summary>Every AI Vehicle is Unused Player Firetruck</summary>

AIs (racers, perps etc, except cops) will drive an unused Firetruck (that was meant for the player to drive, probably a scratched gamemode). You can customize it to any vehicle by changing the vehicle hash ("C3D26AD2") to another's vehicle hash.
To get a hash, use NFS Hasher v2.0 by nfsu360 and input the vehicle string name and copy the value from "VLT Memory" to the code. Unfortunately, you cannot change it to an AI vehicle
